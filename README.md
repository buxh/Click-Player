# Click Player

Simple C++ click player that plays back click delays

## Disclaimer

You need to record and put in your own delays and put them in clicks::clickdata
```c++
std::vector<int> clicks::clickdata = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 };
```
To gather click delays you will need a recorder. Here is a clicker that contains a recorder. [Toad Clicker, Recorder and Player](https://github.com/Steve987321/toadclicker).
